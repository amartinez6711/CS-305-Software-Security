# CS-305-Software-
# Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
Artemis Financial is a financial institution, who develop finanical plans for their customers, wanted to update the security of their software to be the most current and effective to protect their data. 
# What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
I was able to get a better understanding the vulnerabilties that popped up on the Dependecy Check report. Coding securely decreases the chance of vulnerabilites to pop up or threats against the program. Software security helps with the protection and safety of a company's wellbeing.  
# What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
Going over the OWASP Dependency Report Maven was very helpful to look at what vulnerbilities popped up and at seeing what critical level that vulnerability was. 
# How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

# How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
# What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
# Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
